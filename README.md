# Application_of_Linear_Regression_on_Facebook_Page_Metrics

*Prediction of Facebook post popularity using Statistical approach of, Linear Regression modelling using R programming based on the historical page performance metrics.*

## Executive Summary:

*Social Media advertising is the new boom. This research project provides an approach through linear modelling for predicting the performance of the brands Facebook page and hence the type of posts it publishes. The model was developed through the KPI’s provided by the Facebook Insights for the brands page. The final equation predicts the “consumption rate” of a given post with 87.2% accuracy and with an error rate of 0.354. We found that the consumption of a post depends on type of post, category of post, total impressions, reach, and engagement of the post. We found that the if a post is paid or not it is not going to impact our consumption of post.*
